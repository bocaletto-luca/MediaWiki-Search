With a modern, responsive design, Wiki Explorer empowers you to search for articles, filter through topics, and explore detailed information about your subjects of interest—all in one seamless platform.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** Enjoy a sleek and dynamic experience across all devices—from desktops to mobile devices.

- **Article Search & Filtering:** Quickly search for articles by keyword, title, or category and view related topics with ease.
- **Pagination:** Navigate through multiple pages of results with a user-friendly pagination system.
- **Dynamic Modal Display:** Click on an article card to open a modal window that reveals detailed information such as:

  - Additional metadata and relevant details

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project runs entirely within your web browser and does not require any additional dependencies. For development purposes, a code editor with live reload functionality (such as Visual Studio Code with the Live Server extension) is recommended.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
git clone https://github.com/bocaletto-luca/MediaWiki-Explorer.git


2. **Launch the Application**

- Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
- Alternatively, use a live-reload server from your code editor to preview changes in real time.

## How It Works

- **Data Fetching:** Wiki Explorer uses JavaScript's Fetch API to retrieve article information from the MediaWiki API. The JSON response is then used to dynamically generate article cards.
- **Search & Filtering:** Input keywords or select filtered options to quickly locate your topics of interest. The interface updates dynamically.
- **Pagination:** To handle large sets of data, the application splits results into manageable pages allowing for smooth navigation.
- **Dynamic Modal Display:** Clicking on any article card brings up a modal with further details, including a summary, metadata, and links directly to the full Wikipedia article.
